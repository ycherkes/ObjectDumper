This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to dump in-memory objects during debugging to the following formats: C# Object Initialization Code, JSON, Visual Basic Object Initialization Code, XML, and YAML.

The result is shown in a separate document window.

### Known restrictions:
- [C#, F# and VisualBasic](https://github.com/ycherkes/ObjectDumper/blob/main/src/ObjectDumper/DebuggeeInteraction/InteractionService.cs#L25-L30) project languages are currently supported only.
- the debugging code mustn't be optimized so the Expression Evaluator can be run.
- local debugging only.
- it doesn't work for UWP applications, because [UAP doesn't support Assembly.LoadFrom](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/7543). You can bypass this restriction by referencing the .nestandard20 version of [Serialization lib](https://github.com/ycherkes/ObjectDumper/tree/main/src/Serialization) and calling: ```_ = ObjectSerializer.Serialize(null, "cs");``` for loading the serializer into executing assembly. [Example](https://github.com/ycherkes/ObjectDumper/blob/main/samples/uwp/TestUwp/App.xaml.cs#L26)
